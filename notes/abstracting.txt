Abstracting is determining the relationship between parts of syntax.

How to verify program semantics?

Collect data and verify integrity in stages.
    - Collect all abstraction headers.
        - If name and IO counts are found in duplicates, reject verification.
    - Verify all statements in every abstraction adhere to all abstraction headers.
        - Any statements that are not matched to a header, reject verification.
    - Verify all variables in every abstraction.
        - If a variable is used before it is declared, reject verification.
        - If a variable is redeclared as an input or output, reject verification.
    - Verify all offsets in every abstraction.
        - If an offset is declared more than once, reject verification.
        - If an offset is undeclared but used, reject verification.
